# Business Analyst Portfolio Website
In today's digital age, having an online presence is crucial for professionals across all industries. One way to establish an online presence is by creating a personal portfolio website that showcases your skills, experience, and accomplishments. With the increasing demand for data-driven insights in the business world, business analytics professionals are no exception. This is where the Pradyumna.ie website comes into play, offering a sample portfolio for business analytics professionals to display their works and projects in a straightforward manner.

The Pradyumna.ie website is a simple yet effective portfolio website that was built using basic HTML and JS. It is an open-source project hosted on GitHub, which means users can easily download the repository and customize the content to their own needs. The website features a clean and minimalistic design, which allows the user's work to take center stage. It includes a home page, an About Me section, a portfolio page, a blog page, and a contact page.

The home page serves as an introduction to the website, featuring a hero section with a background image and a brief description of the user's skills and experience. The hero section also includes a call-to-action button that directs users to the portfolio page. The About Me section provides more detailed information about the user's background, education, and work experience. It includes a profile picture and a personal statement that gives potential clients or employers insight into the user's personality and work ethic.

The portfolio page is where the user's works and projects are showcased. It includes a grid of images that serve as thumbnails for each project. When a user clicks on a thumbnail, they are directed to a project page that provides more detailed information about the project, including its objective, methodology, and outcomes. The portfolio page also includes a filtering system that allows users to sort projects by category, making it easier to navigate and find relevant projects.

The blog page provides users with an option to publish blog posts on their website, which can help establish their authority and attract potential clients or employers. The blog page features a list of blog posts, with the most recent post appearing first. Each blog post includes a title, a brief summary, and a featured image. Users can click on the post to read the full article.

Finally, the contact page includes an inbuilt contact box that users can fill out to get in touch with the website owner. The contact page also includes the user's email address, phone number, and social media links, making it easy for potential clients or employers to get in touch.

In summary, the Pradyumna.ie website is a great example of a simple and effective portfolio website for business analytics professionals. Its minimalistic design and straightforward layout allow the user's work to shine while providing potential clients or employers with all the necessary information about the user's skills, experience, and accomplishments. Its open-source nature also makes it easy for users to customize the content to their own needs and host it on shared hosting.
